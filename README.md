Tailwind CSS Rich Docs
---------

**Important:** Still at an early stage of development and not ready for use.

This is a Tailwind CSS plugin that adds styles to the raw HTML code (without styles or classes) containing documentation type of content.

[Demo](https://tailwindcss-rich-docs.netlify.com/)

**How to use it?**  
Add the `rich-docs` class to the element which wraps raw HTML code.

**How to use the same font as on the demo site?**  
Add the following code to the `<head>` HTML element:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fira+Sans:200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
